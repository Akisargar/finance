      "Hi everyone.\nWelcome to today&#39;s video.",
      "On today&#39;s video, I&#39;m going to speak\nabout when the markets are going to crash.",
      "Now, this is not a prediction video.",
      "I&#39;m going to show you macro data and going",
      "to explain it to you systematically why\nthe markets might take a while to crash",
      "from this point and why there\nis so much fuss being created.",
      "This is an important\nvideo for two reasons.",
      "Number one is that you might be\nsitting on a lot of profits..",
      "You have made\nlike 30% profits, all that stuff.",
      "Should or I book some profits.",
      "This is question one.",
      "Question two is that you might be\nsitting on a lot of IDle money.",
      "Idle money means you&#39;re just not able\nto understand where to put new money.",
      "This is a challenge that\nyou might be facing.",
      "So this video will help you give\nsome resolution to these two points.",
      "I might do some stock-specific\ncommentary also.",
      "Now, the reason for making\nthis video is very simple.",
      "I run a community called as Wisdom Hatch.",
      "Now, this is India&#39;s biggest\ncommunity of investors right now.",
      "Every day, I keep on getting the\nquestion, Akshat, you know what?",
      "There is an economist\ncalled as Harry Dent..",
      "That market is going to correct badly.",
      "Even like, 2008, recession,.",
      "And 98% crash, InVIDIA,\nand 92% drop, Nasdaq.",
      "So it&#39;s the bubble of all bubbles\nhave been formed, all this stuff.",
      "So it&#39;s okay.",
      "So, so, so, so, so, sophisticated\ninvestors pick up points of Mr.",
      "Warren Buffet, and this is what Mr.",
      "Warren Buffet is doing, that Mr.",
      "Buffet is sitting on record cash.",
      "He has sold some of his positions on",
      "Apple, and he&#39;s sitting on cash\npile of nearing $200 billion.",
      "Okay, so just the back\nin problem, problem.",
      "Nvidia and Warren Buffett\nare holding cash right now.",
      "Now, if you read these type of headlines,\nyou will panic, you will sell your stocks,",
      "you will go away, and that\nmight not be very intelligent.",
      "Now, why am I saying it.",
      "For this, you need to take a look at this",
      "nifty chart, and it&#39;s\ncalled de facto samajana.",
      "What is the meaning of de facto?",
      "De facto means\npractically samajna, this point.",
      "This is an important radical\npoint that I&#39;m making.",
      "Many of you might not agree with it, but",
      "this is the beauty of investing, that if\nyou see logic in things that other people",
      "are not seeing, then chances of you\nmaking more money is much higher.",
      "If you actually take a look from this\nyear, this is year 2000, roughly.,",
      "one could argue that markets\nhave been in a bull run.",
      "Now, what is the meaning?\nTechnical meaning of bull run?",
      "Bull run simply means that the markets\nhave given a breakout of above 20 %.",
      "This is how we define bull run.",
      "And bear run means, from\nits top by more than 20 %.",
      "Now, this technical definition, because",
      "there are times during this phase\nwhen markets have gone down 40, 50 %,.",
      "This was the COVID crash, 40, 50 %.\nHere, 66 %.",
      "Here, 40 odd, 50 odd %.",
      "Here, 20 odd % plus.",
      "So all these phases Second is, yes,",
      "markets have gone down in\nphase one, two, and three.",
      "But again, if you zoom out and\ntake a look at this entire chart,.",
      "Now, the point that I&#39;m trying to make is\nthat see, there are two set of audiences.",
      "The first set of Second is that we\nwill keep on timing the market..",
      "Second is that people who will de facto\nunderstand this chart,",
      "understand the reason why there has\nbeen somewhat of a secular bull run.",
      "In the last 25 odd year, market\nhas not really gone down.",
      "There have never been a phase of five\nyears or more where you put in some money,",
      "even in bulk, and lost\nthat money, so to say.",
      "So that has not been the case.",
      "Please remember this.",
      "This is a second more important point.",
      "The conclusion being that at this\njuncture, you might be again taking a look",
      "at this chart, that market\nis at an all-time high..",
      "See, the The chances are that you might",
      "lose more money by waiting\nfor a market correction.",
      "Then you will lose money, at least on a",
      "five-year basis, if you just\nsimply choose to invest right now.",
      "Now, this is not a push that you should or\nshouldn&#39;t because that comes out at your",
      "portfolio construction stage, which I&#39;ll\nnot be able to comment, but I&#39;m just",
      "trying to show you some\nuseful picture here.",
      "So this is literally point number one.",
      "Now let me explain four\nor five more points.",
      "And what I will do is that I will just",
      "quickly help you understand\nthe history of market crashes.",
      "So this is a very good chart, and this",
      "will help you understand\nand see this picture more.",
      "So again, let&#39;s go back to\nthis phase, this entire phase.",
      "Now this is,\none could argue, one of the best",
      "performing asset classes\nin the last how many years.",
      "In the US, this has been\nperforming since 1950.",
      "So this is absolute crazy.",
      "Yes, there was this phase, this\nwas a substantial sideways phase.",
      "This was the 1960s to 1980s.",
      "But in the 1980s, there has never been a",
      "phase where people have lost money\nin US stock market by investing.",
      "Now, India is a long history in India of",
      "the stock market, so I\ncan&#39;t do this analysis.",
      "But there is a very strong correlation",
      "between US&#39;s stock market\nand India&#39;s stock market.",
      "That is not a US market.\nIt is in US.",
      "It is in India as well.",
      "India is somewhat contingent on US dollar.",
      "Now, almost 60 to 80%, depending on how\nyou are seeing it, almost that level of",
      "world trade happens in\nUS dollar denomination.",
      "So there is a very, very strong",
      "correlation between the US Stock\nMarket and India&#39;s stock market.",
      "The first point of note down, that\nthe stock market has become a rocket for",
      "last how many years, at\nleast for the last 40 years.",
      "Now, if this is the singular\nbet that you&#39;re taking.",
      "I&#39;m like 30 years old right now.",
      "Let me paint a picture for 40, 50 years.",
      "Then what should I really think about?",
      "And how should I process this information?",
      "Because I see so much gloom and gloom.",
      "What data points should I look at?",
      "See, there are two levels of\ninformation that you need to see.",
      "Number one, whenever you are reading this\ntype of news, that Warren Buffett has sold",
      "his portfolio, this, that stuff, at least\ngo and check what he is actually doing.",
      "This is his overall\nportfolio and overall AUM.",
      "Aum means that how big was his portfolio\nas per different quarters.",
      "2022, the data we&#39;re looking at,\nyou are sitting on $363 billion..",
      "That&#39;s the simple point.",
      "Now, this is point one.",
      "But people are creating\nThat&#39;s not necessary panic.",
      "People just process that\nin a very irrational way.",
      "That what exactly is it that Mr.",
      "Warren Buffett is doing?",
      "So he has something called as cash",
      "positions, and he has something called\nas AUM, which I just showed you.",
      "His AUM has barely shrunk by 5, 7%\nfrom its peak in 2022.",
      "He is building up this cash position.\nThere is nothing wrong.",
      "So what he is doing is that he is building\nsomething called as Opportunity Money.",
      "Opportunity.",
      "Now, this is very important in\norder to explore opportunities.",
      "Now, what is the meaning\nof exploring opportunities?",
      "For example, here&#39;s a post\nthat I had done on Tarsons.",
      "Now, Tarsons started to give a run up.",
      "It became like a rocket.",
      "In a day, it gave very good run-up.",
      "Similarly, I had posted about this, about",
      "DeltaCorp, and in one day,\nit gave very good run-up.",
      "These were all opportunities.",
      "These type of opportunities keep\non coming out in the market.",
      "If you have cash sitting on the sidelines,\nyou can always deploy this cash into these",
      "type of opportunities and\nmake some quick gains.",
      "So this is the first utility\nof having a cash portfolio.",
      "What people confuse is people confused,",
      "you know what, Warren Buffett, I&#39;m\nnot in a stock market portfolio.",
      "Aum, he has sold and he&#39;s out of the",
      "market so much money, and he has\nconverted all that money into cash.",
      "He&#39;s not doing that.",
      "This is the advance point\nthat you need to understand.",
      "And in order to understand all these",
      "things, you have to educate\nyourself about the stock market.",
      "I do run courses in case you are a\nbeginner, in case you are an intermediate",
      "player, you will benefit a\nlot by joining those courses.",
      "In case you guys are interested, I&#39;m\nputting the links in the description box.",
      "Do definitely check it out.",
      "The third key point that I&#39;m making\nhere is called as Reinvestment Risk.",
      "Meaning of Reinvestment Risk.",
      "You",
      "are sitting on roughly 40% gains and you\nare thinking, I will pull out my profits.",
      "So you book 40% profits or 40-lack profit.\nGreat.",
      "Awesome.\nCongratulations.",
      "What will you do with this money?",
      "Now you&#39;ll say, Okay, fine.",
      "I have these three, four options.",
      "Number one is that I can do FDs.",
      "Number two, I can go to real\nestate and I can get in loans.",
      "I will go and buy debt.",
      "Debt means that I will\ngo and invest in bonds.",
      "Number 4, I will go and buy gold.",
      "Or number 5, I will go and buy BTC\nor Bitcoin, something like this.",
      "Now, what is the issue here?",
      "If we look at these reinvestment options",
      "in India, what is it\nthat you have to think?",
      "Number 1 point is that if you are actually",
      "going to FDs in 2024, what\nis happening with FDs?",
      "The inflation in the economy is like this.",
      "Fd rates have barely grown like this.",
      "Now, you can keep on arguing with me, you",
      "know what, WPI inflation, CPI\ninflation, the 5, 6% is that stuff.",
      "And the FD rates are giving me 7, 7.\n5%.",
      "How you speak about your\nsegmental inflation.",
      "Segmental inflation is the inflation\nthat you deal with at your level.",
      "For example, if you&#39;re living in Delhi,",
      "Mumbai, Gurgao, you are paying like\n20, 20% rise in your  kid&#39;s school fee.",
      "Segmental inflation for you is not\nlike 4, 5%, it is much higher..",
      "It&#39;s not going to go much.",
      "I&#39;m not dissing on FDs.",
      "Fds serve a purpose.",
      "But to grow your wealth, they\nare not serving a purpose.",
      "Second key point, you\nwill go to real estate.",
      "Now, I&#39;m a proponent of real estate.",
      "I love buying real estate.",
      "But the real estate buying should make",
      "sense if you are able to\nscout very good properties.",
      "And real estate is.",
      "Technically, if you are a white money",
      "person, how much long term\ncapital gains will you pay here?",
      "Well, you will pay 20% long term capital",
      "gains on real estate,\nwhich is absolute crazy.",
      "In equity, it&#39;s only 10%.",
      "So you have 40,000, here, real estate,\nit does not make much sense.",
      "What about debt?",
      "There used to be a inverse\ncycle between debt and equity.",
      "Like equity, It used to come to equities.",
      "So one could argue that debt used\nto act as a hedge against equities.",
      "Now that relationship\nis completely broken.",
      "Now, why has it been broken?",
      "So for that, I will quickly comment on\na topic called as yield Curve Inversion.",
      "Now, yield curve inversion.",
      "Now, yield curve inversion, this is the\ndifference between your two-year",
      "bond returns and 10-year\nbond returns, so to say.",
      "Two-year, this is short-term debt.",
      "Ten-year, this is long-term debt.",
      "Usually, relationship is when you are",
      "depositing money on long-term basis,\nyou should get a higher rate of return.",
      "If\nyou&#39;re depositing money for a short-term",
      "rate, then you should get\nlike lower-term return, 6%.",
      "This spread needs to be there and this\nspread needs to be positive, the",
      "difference between long\nterm and short term.",
      "Yield Curve Inversion means that the debt\nmarket has been broken down to such an",
      "extent and it has been skewed to such\nan extent that is a long term debt.",
      "People are not trusting it.",
      "And as a result, the spread between these",
      "two things has almost come down to zero,\nand in some cases, it has become negative.",
      "Now, very interesting data here that it",
      "became negative here, it became\nnegative here after 2020..",
      "But why 2008 this became negative\nand 2020 it became negative?",
      "Because debt market has been killed.",
      "What do I mean by debt\nmarket has been killed?",
      "For example, if you invest in corporate\ndebt, usually, HNI, FII, DII, they invest.",
      "Why?",
      "Because the ticket size\nof debt used to be high.",
      "If you either invest via mutual funds\nor you pick a higher quantum of debt.",
      "I&#39;m just putting that number, arbitrary",
      "number, but this number\nused to be very high.",
      "Now what has happened is\nthat democratization of debt.",
      "What is democratization?",
      "It&#39;s",
      "because of the simple reason, this",
      "instrument, systematically is\nbeing killed, unnecessarily.",
      "Because the middle-class person who\ncan&#39;t afford a house, what do we do?",
      "We need to spend the\nmoney on the middle-class.",
      "We take the REITs..",
      "If you actually understand it sensibly",
      "from an economics principle\nperspective, it makes no sense.",
      "Reets, I can show you.",
      "Where a house should be worth 4\ncrores, but reits can be a real estate.",
      "Now the party that is running\nthis reets will now sell it to.",
      "Now, if you are investing in these crazy",
      "items, you are, of course,\ngoing to lose money.",
      "Bottom line, without getting into the",
      "economics behind it too much,\ndebt has been systematically killed.",
      "Real estate has been\nsystematically killed due to what?",
      "Due to excessive taxation.",
      "So now,.",
      "So see, FDs are not beating inflation.",
      "Real estate is not a tradable instrument.",
      "It has low liquidity.\nIt&#39;s good.",
      "There is no problem in real estate.",
      "Not rates, two very, very good asset.",
      "In fact, one of my primary movers in the",
      "last one year, it has given me\n180% gains in the last one year.",
      "But in India, can you\nsystematically buy BTC?",
      "Not really.\nWhat about gold?",
      "Gold may be a lot of money.",
      "There is again no point or\nnot much point going here.",
      "You can find my views to be radical.",
      "Honestly, my goal is to give\nyou rational, sensible data.",
      "World changes.",
      "People who do not change become\ndinosaurs and they get disrupted.",
      "And a lot of people are going to\nget disrupted in the next few years.",
      "So having macro analysis\nskills, understanding it.",
      "I spent crazy amount of time studying the\nworld, studying the world of economics,",
      "personally visiting a lot of countries\nnow, studying, meeting a lot of rich",
      "people, understanding their\nviewpoint of investing.",
      "I get to do this by running my hedge fund.",
      "It has opened a lot of doors for me in",
      "order to analyze the\nmarkets, all that stuff.",
      "And I try to bring that But",
      "where will you take it?",
      "This This is the primary problem\nthat investors right now are facing.",
      "I&#39;ve been having this\nconversation with a lot of H&amp;Is..",
      "We have been watching your videos, we have\nbeen speaking with you, all that stuff.",
      "But what do we do?",
      "We started It is like 10 crores.",
      "Now it is like 14 crores,\nsomething like this.",
      "What do we do?\nShould we book profits?",
      "What is it that we should be doing?",
      "Okay, very simple words.\nWe should follow Mr.",
      "Warren Buffett.",
      "Have some opportunity cash which you can\ndeploy when opportunities come and add",
      "that same time, do do not\ngo undervalued on equities.",
      "Equities should still be a\nsignificant portion of your portfolio.",
      "I am not pulling it out.",
      "When we clearly see that there is a\nmassive euphoria, then of course, there",
      "can be a deep correction, and\nthen we can somewhat time it.",
      "But right now is not the\nphase of timing that.",
      "We are not in that euphoric phase.",
      "And I&#39;ve been one of the very few analysts",
      "who has been saying it for the\nlast two, two and a half years..",
      "I mean, YouTube, they&#39;re getting\na lot of videos on all that stuff.",
      "When crash was going on, no one had the\ncourage to make these type of videos.",
      "Anyways, coming back to the topic, and",
      "there are final two, three\npoints that I will tell you.",
      "See, point number one is that you\nshould be ready for minor corrections.",
      "Now, what is the meaning\nof minor corrections?",
      "I&#39;m going to show you.",
      "I have at least been four or five times.",
      "What should you do when\nyou find minor corrections?",
      "This is very important.",
      "This is where my community\ncomes into the picture because.",
      "I was there through the entire day\nguiding my community, what to do, etc.",
      "If you are a serious investor, I would",
      "still suggest definitely\ngo check out my community.",
      "You will learn a lot.",
      "Basically, you have that cash component.",
      "This is where you should use it.",
      "You should not be panicking..",
      "It will still grow like this only.\nWhy?",
      "Because the debt on the\nworld is increasing.",
      "In fact, I will show you\none quick graph also here.",
      "This has to do with government expenses.",
      "Here are government interest repayments.",
      "It is this type of money, 1997.",
      "This, exponentially.",
      "People think that stock market returns are",
      "directly proportional to\nthe strength of the economy.",
      "Economy is going to tatters.",
      "It&#39;s not doing anything much.",
      "In fact, at one point in time, on a\nfive-year basis, Zimbabwe&#39;s stock market",
      "was the best performing\nstock market in the world.",
      "Zimbabwe&#39;s economy is not a turrum,\nit&#39;s really doing all that stuff.",
      "But people don&#39;t want to\nunderstand all these facts.",
      "So anyways, coming back to the topic, see,\nbasically, divide your portfolio into two.",
      "The first part of your portfolio,\nit should be in the stock market.",
      "Do not go equity light.",
      "Now, it really depends.",
      "For example, personally speaking, most\n65, 70% of my networth is in equities.",
      "How much ever you want to invest.",
      "On top of that, what I&#39;m doing right\nnow is that I&#39;m building a cash bucket.",
      "Like Mr.",
      "Warren Buffet, I&#39;m going to put that money\nto use when there is for 10% correction.",
      "And these type of minor\ncorrections will happen.",
      "Now, when will they happen?",
      "But if you just wait, you will definitely\nget these 10, 10% opportunities.",
      "So the split that I&#39;m using is that, Hey,\nI&#39;m trying to create, let&#39;s say, if I have",
      "one CR in the market, then\nI would at least have 20 Ls as my cash",
      "bucket because then I can take\nadvantages of these type of phases.",
      "This is literally point one.",
      "Point two has to do with the\nconcept of diversification.",
      "Since the day I have started my YouTube",
      "channel, I have been a firm\nadvocate of diversification.",
      "People keep on asking me,.",
      "For example, I purchased HDFC Bank.",
      "I have a lot of faith on HDFC Bank.",
      "What can I do?\nNumbers are good.",
      "Everything is good.\nEveryone understands.",
      "No one is panicking by holding HDFC Bank.",
      "On the flip side, I had purchased Aawas.",
      "It has given massive run-up.",
      "Hdfc, AMC, it has given crazy run-up.",
      "Zomato, DoubleSight, B-Zada, ho gya.",
      "Equitas, Jio Small Finance, Punj National",
      "Bank, Meta, 250% run-up\nand all that stuff.",
      "You basically buy a bunch of stocks.",
      "You allocate your money into...",
      "Some stocks will work,\nsome stocks will not work.",
      "That&#39;s how investing world operates.",
      "If people are telling you otherwise,\nthey&#39;re just",
      "You will keep on acting on all those\nrecommendations and you&#39;ll go bonkers.",
      "You just have to pick your set of 30, 40",
      "stocks, be well diversified\nin that, and that&#39;s it.",
      "And have a faith, even when\nthings are not running.",
      "For example, right now\nis HDFC Bank running?.",
      "Now, happy faces.",

      "okay kumaras is the first one to answer",
      "it is a breakout of Channel fantastic",
      "followed by two three answers back to",
      "back breakout breakout resistance brok",
      "broken he&#39;s talking about weak also",
      "double I I was showing a monthly chart",
      "person is also saying breakout",
      "consolidation",
      "Channel break fantastic I I&#39;m stopping W",

      "should be clear um anyway so I hope of",
      "course there can be multiple things that",
      "you can look into okay but one very very",
      "very clear thing is that yes it is",
      "definitely a a consolidation and",
      "breakout I could see a lot of inverted",
      "Head and Shoulders answers also okay",
      "there is a small point for inverted Head",
      "and Shoulder I&#39;ll tell you that why is",
      "it not actually inverted Head and",
      "Shoulder okay um one minute",
      "uh okay so here if you see so maybe",
      "you&#39;re trying to see it something like",
      "this this is the shoulder this is the",
      "head and again this is the shoulder",
      "maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do",
      "right where has the pattern come up",
      "that&#39;s very very very important you can",
      "see that there was a nice run up then",
      "there is a inverted Head and Shoulder",
      "and then it goes up no inverted Head and",
      "Shoulder doesn&#39;t come like that ideally",
      "inverted Head and Shoulder comes",
      "something like this there is a down",
      "downturn okay so basically there is a",
      "downward",
      "Journey okay or we call that as a",
      "downtrend downtrend is indicated by",
      "lower highs and lower lows okay so",
      "basically there is a downtrend that is",
      "number one then you see a shoulder a",
      "head and a shoulder and then if we see",
      "that there is a breakout okay then we",
      "say that yes this is a reversal pattern",
      "and then then we call it as a head",
      "inverse head and shoulder pattern this",
      "is this looking like it absolutely yes",
      "but we call inverted Head and Shoulder",
      "as a reversal pattern so it&#39;s more",
      "effective theoretically it should come",
      "at the end of a downtrend okay that is",
      "the reason why I&#39;m saying that rather",
      "than saying this as an rather than",
      "treating this as an inverted Head and",
      "Shoulder we should treat it as a",
      "resistance breakout clear simple and",

      "the alltime high it came down agreed but",
      "already a similar high was taken out and",
      "then this and this right so if I&#39;m",
      "talking about a slanting trend line that",
      "has also been broken out and that&#39;s why",
      "it definitely looks interesting okay so",
      "see whenever I&#39;m talking about these",
      "stocks so what which stocks did we",
      "discuss today today we discussed about",
      "First Reliance then we discussed about",
      "TCS then we discussed about Vio then we",
      "discussed about",
      "Apple what is to be done with these STS",
      "go and buy not at",
      "all we have to add these to our watch",
      "list do your own analysis if you feel",
      "based on your analysis it is buy you can",
      "go ahead and buy if you feel it&#39;s",
      "rubbish don&#39;t do anything wait wait and",
      "watch okay if you feel this is the worst",
      "thing that I&#39;ve ever seen I need to sell",
      "it your call okay I&#39;m telling you how to",
      "interpret the chats final decision",
      "obviously will be yours but those who",
      "again have done my course on technical",
      "analysis they understand the importance",
      "of charts they will be able to analyze",
      "them as well so again you know that&#39;s",
      "that&#39;s the magic of technical analysis",
      "and final stock is again one of our",
      "stock of the months pretty recent stock",
      "of the months uh wherein we discussed",
      "about this stock in absolute detail in",
      "the fundamental analysis",
      "wow drawn so many lines okay",
      "um there is a clear drawings option now",
      "hide all CH this will give you a better",
      "idea of what I&#39;m saying okay now what is",
      "the important Point",
      "here let me just add the if I&#39;ve hidden",
      "the volumes that&#39;s going to happen okay",
      "no worries okay so if you see here I&#39;m",
      "just first going to tell you the pure",
      "price see whenever we do technical",
      "analysis there is something called as",
      "price action analysis okay you either",
      "see the price or the action it&#39;s wrong",
      "you have to do both you have to do a",
      "price and an action analysis so if you",
      "see here the stock was actually in a",
      "downward Trend then if you saw it was in",
      "a consolidation phase and then boom it",
      "saw a very nice day where it went up 20%",
      "immediate next day also it had locked",
      "itself at upper circuit but then it",
      "eventually cooled off to 5% and then",
      "back to back 1 2 3",
      "4 I could hear that sound in my",
      "ears these are the comedy channels they",
      "use these stones for no PO something",
      "went wrong right so that is what we can",
      "see here that whatever games it had got",
      "it&#39;s almost at this level right now this",
      "is where the journey started this was",
      "the open price so can I say that if this",
      "was the open",
      "price oh I have hidden the",
      "drawings my God now I have to delete all",
      "these so that to get some clear idea",
      "that&#39;s the bad point of doing analysis",
      "so many analysis whenever I I get time",
      "I&#39;m I&#39;m a student of the stock market",
      "whenever I get time I keep on you know",
      "learning and learning and learning",
      "anyways okay so this is one important",
      "level okay because this should ideally",
      "act as a good support",
      "okay this is also one level which was",
      "the low point for that day same day okay",
      "so basically now this will be like a",
      "good we call this as a support zone now",
      "because it&#39;s saw some nice consolidation",
      "here some nice consolidation here so we",
      "what what do we call this we call this",
      "as a",
      "support Zone okay this is a pure play",
      "price analysis now let me teach you what",
      "is volume analysis or what is action",
      "analysis okay very very important point",
      "just look at this look at the volume",
      "bars now this is almost like invisible",
      "volume bars correct and here you can see",
      "a nice volume pump two days back to back",
      "this day have a look at the volume",
      "immediate next day so this is this day&#39;s",
      "volume the big volume bar is the 20%",
      "upside another one is another 20% upside",
      "so what does this indicate whenever the",
      "stock was going up the buying was not",
      "done by very small number of people",
      "buying was done by big number of people",
      "but when it came down to",
      "selling of one 2 three four days back to",
      "back from this high I can say from this",
      "high to the low it&#39;s almost 12% down",
      "okay pay attention almost 12% down but",
      "look at at the selling volumes",
      "Chiller selling volumes are not that big",
      "buying volumes are very",
      "high you can also appreciate the same",
      "thing in a weekly time frame see this",
      "was the huge volume that we have seen in",
      "the first two three four months they a",
      "complete volume dry up here you can see",
      "two three good volumes complete dry up",
      "and",
      "Z very nice very nice volume pump right",
      "even if you see here very similar thing",
      "you&#39;ll be able to see 1 2 two big days I",
      "mean two big months volume wise as well",
      "then almost pretty much on the lower",
      "side and this month again T shot up this",
      "is like the third highest volume that we",
      "can see on a monthly",
      "basis do you like this analysis so",
      "generally we do talk about charts we do",
      "talk about uh you know different",
      "patterns but very rarely do we talk",
      "about a pure play price action analysis",
      "do you like the price action analysis",
      "Gish is saying oh my God volume exactly",
      "right when I when I when I was doing the",
      "analysis with my team we were like what",
      "is this such a huge",
      "volume I mean this was this was crazy",
      "right people are saying yes yes yes yes",
      "absolutely so very nice volume coming in",
      "for this stock so again I&#39;m repeating",
      "whatever stocks we discussed today you",
      "have to add this up I&#39;m repeating it for",
      "you we discussed Reliance Industries we",
      "discussed TCS we discussed wio we",
      "discussed apple and we discussed map",
      "India so be very very very sure that you",
      "add these stocks to your watch list",
      "whenever time permits do your own",
      "analysis uh daily try and understand how",
      "the price is behaving basically now what",
      "I feel I I&#39;m just going to quickly tell",
      "you uh about the",
      "Nifty level if you see our standard",
      "thing consolidation d d went up last",
      "Thursday I think or before that maybe I",
      "told you that yes it has broken out but",
      "it&#39;s not it&#39;s not gaining I mean we",
      "can&#39;t see any Greenery here all red red",
      "red candles ultimately it has decided to",
      "you know move",
      "otherwise with good strength and you can",
      "see four to four four candles back to",
      "back 16% upward movement almost a perc",
      "move upward half a percent move almost",
      "upward and again 34 percentage move move",
      "upward but from here to here almost you",
      "can see that Nifty itself has rallied by",
      "almost",
      "3% good good sign it&#39;s it&#39;s going",
      "stronger and what I see right now based",
      "on technical analysis again is that uh",
      "you know uh the the big point is that",
      "whenever big players something like a",
      "Reliance Industries Reliance Industries",
      "has given an all-time high breakout very",
      "important Point coming up Reliance",
      "Industries has given an alltime high",
      "breakout and if that be so if that",
      "starts performing well Reliance",
      "Industries is one of the key",
      "weightage of",
      "if Reliance starts moving up Nifty is",
      "also going to move up if uh you know if",
      "HDFC keeps on moving up Nifty is going",
      "to move up so right now I don&#39;t see any",
      "reason why there should be panic but",
      "having said that uh very important Point",
      "having said that 1st July",
      "budget again there can be a lot of",
      "uncertainty be careful even if you are",
      "bullish don&#39;t invest all in one shot",
      "it&#39;s never ever a good idea to invest in",
      "one shot and absolutely a rubbish idea",
      "when it is especially about investing",
      "just before days which could be",
      "uncertain days okay so in what direction",
      "the market moves based on budget we are",
      "not sure on that so be very careful with",
      "these on trading with on these days uh",
      "or even investing on these days U always",
      "always better to invest 1 1th 1 1th",
      "whatever stocks you have decided right",
      "so I hope you have understood that even",
      "if we did talk about Reliance Industries",
      "which is which has broken out of its",
      "alltime high chances that if it is",
      "supported with a good momentum again",
      "Poss possible that may see a higher high",
      "and if Reliance is strong of course",
      "Nifty is going to be strong because of",
      "the weightage Reliance has on has in",
      "Nifty right so uh I hope how how was",
      "this I mean uh today I I started uh I I",
      "I think yes uh most most probably yes",
      "that&#39;s what I remember",
      "uh very good question your view on Mid",
      "capap indices they are just moving in",
      "One Direction our valuation stretched",
      "over there uh see right now what I feel",
      "is that rather than midcaps small the",
      "rather than midcaps and small caps is",
      "the large",
      "caps that have been seeing a lot of",
      "attention right now okay so very very",
      "important large caps if they start",
      "performing well then again great chances",
      "that you know Nifty also moves in uh in",
      "the same direction so uh today that is",
      "the reason why I thought that we should",
      "actually uh you know talk about certain",
      "technical analysis some specific stocks",
      "and how to actually uh you know learn",
      "and understand about how the prices",
      "could move based on the charts right",
      "uh ragav is asking a question okay last",
      "two streams I asked about an by telling",
      "you it was following reverse cup pattern",
      "which I Learned was from you but I saw",

      "in a downward Trend it was in a downward",
      "Trend and if you see here perfect",

      "that it&#39;s forming a base here now it&#39;s",
      "interesting",
      "one okay",
      "uh in your video you told that Geo",
      "Finance has some 6% stake in Reliance",

      "good question do we need to wait adding",
      "additional shares in maruti until Hundai",
      "IPO is live in the market so typically",
      "what I have seen is that whenever a",
      "company comes up with an IPO it&#39;s",
      "competitors also start seeing some Buzz",
      "because Hundai Hyundai Hundai whatever",
      "and maruti both being from the",
      "automobile space uh whenever hyund comes",
      "up with its IPO ideally you should",

      "Spike also so uh I mean again you can",
      "you can decide but that is the time when",
      "we can see some action I can say in in",
      "the market as far as these stocks are",
      "concerned",
      "right",
      "okay very good question G if the volume",
      "of selling are low why the price dropped",
      "more than expected see uh what happens",
      "you know whenever the volume of selling",
      "is low it means that there are great",
      "chances that retailers are selling see",
      "whenever domestic institutions sell",
      "they&#39;ll sell big they&#39;re not going to",
      "sell Chiller shares like us",
      "100 200 500 we are the ones who share",
      "the chiller amount of or Chiller volume",
      "of shares right but if that be so what",
      "happens is that whenever volume is less",
      "and the price is dropping it means that",
      "the flow is coming in the supply is",
      "coming in because of which we can see",
      "some price pressure there there are no",
      "big buyers who are out there selling is",
      "happening there are more number of",
      "sellers less number of buyers that is",
      "why you can see a price pressure but the",
      "overall volume is not that great and",
      "that these could be signs we can&#39;t prove",
      "it but I&#39;m just telling you by my",
      "experience that there there is a great",
      "chance that in such cases it&#39;s the",
      "retailers who are selling rather than",
      "the institutional invest because the",
      "volume is dried up and uh in fact these",
      "are opportunities uh which we can check",
      "out for again not a recommendation but",
      "that shows us that yes selling is",
      "happening but big players are not",
      "selling if they are not selling why",
      "aren&#39;t they selling do they see",
      "something that&#39;s how we have to analyze",
      "right so I hope you have understood but",

      "was not that great. They did certain layoffs \nwherein they shrunk their workforce by almost  ",
      "4%. Now comes a very important point which is \nabout platform fees that they started in August  ",
      "2023 with just 2 rupees as platform fee per order. \nLatest data, their platform fee is 5 rupees now.  ",
      "When I did a video on ZOMATO few months ago, I \ntold you that 1.3 million orders is what they  ",
      "deliver per day. But as per the latest you know \ninterview which I saw of one of their Founders,  ",
      "2 million is the latest data of the number of \norders. So you can imagine 20 lakh orders per  ",
      "day is what they are delivering and with 5 rupees \nplatform fee 1 Crore Rupees is the revenue just  ",
      "based out of platform fees. So that is something \nreally interesting. Plus the number of restaurants  ",
      "that they used to cater to was originally 150k. \nWhen I did that video as of the latest data,  ",
      "it is 2,47,000 restaurants. Right. So if you can \nsee a restaurant partners are also increasing at  ",
      "a CAGR at 17% and delivery partners are also \nincreasing at a CHR of almost 21%. So all in  ",
      "all good growth is what we can see in the the \nfood delivery business. But this is not what the  ",
      "founders are betting on. Something more and that \nis not about the food delivery business. They are  ",
      "betting more on the BLINKET business. Now first \nwe need to understand BLINKET is nothing but in  ",
      "the Quick Commerce segment. Right. So let me just \nagain focus first BLINKET is based on the Quick  ",
      "Commerce segment right and here it&#39;s more about \ndelivering stuff in less than let us say 10 to  ",
      "15 minutes okay. Now you can understand that yes \nthere have been multiple competitors as well. I&#39;m  ",
      "sure you have heard about ZEPTO. You have heard \nabout Swiggy Instamart. You have heard about  ",
      "BLINKET which is a fully owned ZOMATO company by \nthe way. Okay. And the fourth one you might have  ",
      "also heard about Big Basket. Now if you remember \nthe early mover advantage was with Big Basket.  ",
      "In fact they were the leaders in the segment for \nquite a long time. But still they were not able to  ",
      "sustain that for a long time. I mean they were the \nbusiness leader for a long time but were not able  ",
      "to sustain it eventually and right now if you know \namongst the competitors they are at the bottommost  ",
      "position. Okay. So what their founder has also \nvery clearly mentioned in one of their interviews  ",
      "is that he said that yes BLINKET or any other \nbusiness is what he says that will not I mean  ",
      "none of the business models that are created \nright now will last for more than a decade is  ",
      "what the founder says and that is the reason why \nthey he has mentioned that you need to innovate  ",
      "and create new businesses is what Mr. Deepinder \nGoyal said right so what he&#39;s saying that even if  ",
      "we feel that yes BLINKIT is Big this that if they \ndon&#39;t change then they will not be able to sustain  ",
      "in the longer run. Right. In fact talking going \nback to Big Basket if you remember they started  ",
      "with delivering groceries or delivering milk I \nmean daily needs is what you can say but they  ",
      "used to tell us that if you want milk let us say \nin the early morning and eggs in the early morning  ",
      "you need to place the order let us say by 10 or \n11 at night. But what did BLINKET say ? Are you  ",
      "tell us we&#39;ll deliver it to you in 15 minutes. \nWhy do you have to place the order like one  ",
      "night before ? Not required. In fact they started \nwith these things like milk, eggs, grocery this  ",
      "that but eventually they have moved on to a lot of \nstuff something like electronics, fashion and they  ",
      "are foring into newer and newer areas. Now along \nwith this, what is BLINKIT&#39;s biggest advantage is  ",
      "the number of dark stores that they have. Now \njust in case if you don&#39;t know what is a dark  ",
      "store ? Dark store is nothing but like a warehouse \nwhich the company has in which they you know have  ",
      "a lot of items which are frequently ordered. Now \nyou can imagine if these dark stores are located  ",
      "in densely populated areas where the number of \norders are pretty high then you can imagine, the  ",
      "delivery time will be very less. If the dark store \nis located in a very good spot, Sweet spot. Sweet  ",
      "Spot means what where the population is pretty \nmuch highly dense right and that is what they  ",
      "have targeted and they have a very nice count of \nthe stores. Now coming to the funding side, ZOMATO  ",
      "because they believe in this segment they are \npumping 300 crores more into BLINKET that&#39;s that  ",
      "shows the confidence that they have in BLINKET. \nBut don&#39;t get very much you know excited because  ",
      "I&#39;m going to tell you about their competitor as \nwell ZEPTO. This is a very latest news just five  ",
      "six days ago. They raised a total funding latest \nfunding round basically was of $665 million and if  ",
      "you were to translate that into Rupees it&#39;s almost \n5,600 Crore rupees. Now ultimately it&#39;s going to  ",
      "be a deep pocket game. A company which is able to \nbring in more funding, a company which is able to  ",
      "burn more if they are able to come up with newer \nand newer concepts newer and newer ways to deliver  ",
      "quicker and deliver a wider range of products \nthey are going to win this game. But I believe  ",
      "that right now because BLINKET has you know proven \nitself in this area right now to a great extent,  ",
      "if they keep on keep up pace with whatever they \nare doing they are set to you know grow bigger  ",
      "and bigger. Now if I compare the store count \nbecause right now we did talk about the funding  ",
      "of ZEPTO. Let&#39;s also talk about the store count. \nSee Instamart has 490 outlets, ZEPTO has 360 but  ",
      "BLINKET has 526 stores as at FY24 and they plan \nto take it to 1,000 stores by FY25. Now the point  ",
      "that I mentioned you more and more stores is equal \nto what more and more stores is equal to they will  ",
      "be able to deliver in the shortest possible time \nokay. But now one question pops up here is that if  ",
      "they keep on adding more and more stores will it \nlead to a bigger and bigger outlay of funds ? The  ",
      "answer is NO. Because now they are also going to \nturn to franchise model. So just as an example,  ",
      "if you want to start a dark store, you need to do \nsome investment. They will give you some return  ",
      "on your investment plus you&#39;ll also get some \npercentage of sales something like that. Okay. So  ",
      "all in all there was a survey also which was made \nby THE ARK and they said that this is going to be  ",
      "a pretty interesting franchise model. They have \nalso mentioned in their article that typically  ",
      "dark store peaks at 1,500 to 1,700 daily orders \non weekday and 2,000 to 2,500 orders on weekend  ",
      "at this junction. So you can imagine what high \nnumber of orders that they are seeing right  ",
      "now that&#39;s pretty interesting. So just to sum up \nZOMATO scale in Quick Commerce is now 50% larger  ",
      "than competitors ZEPTO in quick Commerce means \nI&#39;m talking about BLINKET It&#39;s larger by 50%  ",
      "than its competitors. So they are way ahead of it \ncompetitors. Very clearly we can understand that  ",
      "and Goldman Sachs reports as ZOMATO continues \nto improve profitability particularly in Quick  ",
      "Commerce multiples could further rerate is what \nGoldman Sachs has also mentioned. Right. So this  ",
      "was about the key component that I wanted to focus \nmore on talking quickly about going out business.  ",
      "They do have this going out dining out basically \nif I were to go to a restaurant I can book a table  ",
      "to through their app. I also can get some offers \nand that is how I can use this feature of dining  ",
      "out. They also have something like ZOMATO LIVE. \nThat&#39;s into events. By the way you might have also  ",
      "read about this news. Very recent news. 18th June \nnews wherein it was mentioned that ZOMATO plans to  ",
      "acquire paytm movie business. That will be about \ntheir online event segment that we discussed in  ",
      "the beginning. So that is what is the news. But \nimmediately clarification was given by ZOMATO that  ",
      "yes we have read a lot of news. We have noticed \nthat there are certain news articles about this  ",
      "but currently it is not I mean you know they have \nnot taken any ultimate decision. No final decision  ",
      "is taken by ZOMATO is the clarification that they \nhad given. Talking about the last one which is B2B  ",
      "business not a big one it&#39;s about hyper pure this \nis where they source raw material to hotels okay.  ",
      "So this is about the B2B business is it scaling \nyes a good CAGR 152% but all in all it&#39;s it&#39;s a  ",
      "very small. I mean the volume itself is very small \nand that is the reason why you can see a higher  ",
      "CAGR. Okay. EBITDA they are into negative still \nat minus 4% at an EBITDA margin level is what  ",
      "I&#39;m saying. Now talking about financials yes food \ndelivery business is growing the GOV is growing  ",

      "revenue generation is currently being done by \nfood delivery. But it is said that the Quick  ",
      "Commerce BLINKET that can actually overtake the \nfood delivery business is what their management  ",
      "also feels in a matter of roughly one year is \nwhat their management has mentioned right. Now  ",
      "some interesting research that our team has also \ndone. See just have a look at this. Okay. What can  ",
      "you see here a thumbs up bottle on Amazon costs 40 \nrupees but on BLINKET costs 45 rupees because they  ",
      "are giving here at a discount of 11% discount to \nMRP here they are giving no discount but here you  ",
      "can get it in 11 minutes here you&#39;ll maybe take \none day. okay so here for convenience they&#39;re  ",
      "selling it at MRP and that is where they can gain \nmore money right but if you see about certain  ",
      "Electronics on Amazon you can get this boat \nheadphone at 1499 but on BLINKET you can get the  ",
      "same one see I&#39;m talking about boat airdopes 170 \nTWS earbuds Boat airdopes 170 TWS same here you  ",
      "can get it at 999 here it was at 1499. So you can \nget it at a cheaper price at BLINKET. But there  ",
      "are some products here you can see OnePlus buds \nthe are these are at 2499 and BLINKET same OnePlus  ",
      "not buds at 2499. So here you can understand that \na one more example. They have also fored into  ",
      "kurtas and here you can see this is an example \nof MYNTRA the the kurtas range from 900 to 1200  ",
      "delivery time could be somewhere around 2 to 4 \ndays and BLINKIT is at 929 delivery in 10 minutes.  ",
      "This is crazy right. So I think this is going to \nbe something as a game changer. So if you see here  ",
      "all in all for some products they are charging \nmore or less similar right for some products they  ",
      "are charging lesser as compared to competitors for \nsome products they are charging a little bit more  ",

      "they are doing their own analysis and they also \nmention about the Synergy that they have. See  ",
      "overall what they are saying this is like the sum \nup point now they mentioned that yes we do have  ",
      "Synergy benefits because any person who&#39;s going to \norder for the food delivery is a likely customer  ",

      "According to yeah there are some small impacts of \npollution of course and yeah that impacts slightly  ",

      "installation is possible. Agreed. Before I move \non to the financial part of it I also wanted to  ",
      "ask one more thing because my viewers would \nbe seeing this just around the may end. So  ",

      "rainfall days but we are able to install the \ncivil structures even during rainfall. Got it.  ",
      "Fantastic !!! Cool !!! Now, Vitamin M !!! Vitamin \nM !!! Very important. So if we talk about the  ",
      "monetary angle first things first I wanted to ask \nthat if we are a family of let&#39;s say five people  ",
      "okay and if we were to fit a solar panel for our \nhome how much would be my typical saving ? I have  ",
      "a lot of questions wait I ask 3-4 together. Okay. \nHow much would be my typical saving before that  ",
      "how much will be like a capex capital expenditure \na one time money spending which will be required  ",

      "me just clarify that your how many members are \nin your family that shouldn&#39;t dictate what&#39;s the  ",
      "solar project size. Okay typically is a function \nof what&#39;s your annual consumption of electricity  ",
      "bill. So we study your monthly bill and then we&#39;ll \nrecommend. So typically if you have 300 to 350  ",
      "units consumption in a monthly average basis then \nwe recommend you 3 to 3 and half kilowatt system  ",
      "depending on which location you are in. Let&#39;s say \n3 kilowatt system is the ideal system size that  ",
      "comes as per your location. 3 Kilowatt system \nshould typically offset 4,000 to 4,200 units  ",
      "for you in a year. right For now in Maharashtra \nthe rates have gone up by the way from 1st April  ",
      "2024 the electricity rates have gone by 10% in \nfixed cost I think 7 to 8% in the variable cost  ",
      "altogether so what used to be 11.8 rupees 12 \nrupees tariff it has gone up to 12.8-13 rupees  ",
      "tariff now. So obviously your returns will \nbe better now. With Solar, typical investment  ",
      "for a 3 Kilowatt system, it starts typically at \n2,10,000 rupees and it goes up depending on the  ",
      "packages that you typically choose. okay and you \nget subsidy although from government. Sorry to cut  ",
      "you but you said it starts at 2 lakh 10,000 right \n? What could be an average cost. Because 2 lakh  ",
      "10,000 will be the minimum is what you&#39;re talking \nabout. What would be the average ? The 3 Kilowatt  ",
      "system would typically based on the most customers \nthat buy from us they choose 2,25,000 rupees  ",
      "package with maintenance included in it right. \nSo you also get subsidy from the government. So  ",
      "there is a good subsidy from PM SURYA GHAR scheme \nwhich is recently launched by Prime Minister Modi.  ",
      "Under this scheme the customers would get 78,000 \nrupees subsidy just like it used to be like uh  ",
      "your LPG cylinders similarly your subsidy will \nget back in your account in directly credited to  ",
      "my bank directly going to get credited to your \naccount in how many days 30 to 45 days is the  ",
      "ideal day they are planning uh so most of our \ncustomers have got in 45 days roughly fantastic  ",
      "they are improving upon it the systems are getting \nbetter so let&#39;s assume that your net investment is  ",
      "around 1,50,000 rupees correct right with solar 3 \nkilowatt system 4,000 unit generated you are going  ",
      "to save 13 Rupees to be paid per unit to the grid \nso 4,000 into 13 let&#39;s say round of 50,000 Rupees  ",

      "your investment 50,000 savings every year correct \nthat takes 3 years for you to recover your amount  ",
      "so the IRR is much much better we have seen \nthat uh FD&#39;s are typically giving you 7 and  ",
      "half % returns the gold over last 5 to 10 years \nyou see 9% returns are what the gold has given  ",
      "the mutual funds 12 to 15% depending on your risk \nportfolio but rooftop solar 20 to 40% this is what  ",
      "depending on the rate of your specific State. \nEven if it is at the lower and 20% is still not  ",
      "bad at all right yes yes so Bangalore customers \nprobably will see 20 to 25% somewhere around that  ",
      "Maharashtra customers will see north of 30% okay \nyeah fantastic wow so my points I think you me  ",
      "mentioned about four to five family members is \nnot the criteria it should be how much is the  ",
      "unit consumption so let&#39;s say if just whatever \nhe spoke I&#39;m just wrapping it up let&#39;s say your  ",
      "monthly bill is coming around 4,000 rupees right \nnow so just to round it off again for 12*4 are 48  ",
      "we&#39;re rounding it up to 50,000 is the yearly bill \nwhich will be waved off automatically if you have  ",
      "a solar right so within 3 years you&#39;ll have your \npayback period and after which only whatever is  ",
      "the annual maintenance that will have to be PA and \nhow much would be the annual maintenance roughly  ",
      "so typically solar Square packages uh five years \nmaintenance so you do not need to pay anything  ",

      "I think first five years you mentioned no uh you \nhave to choose that plan of course of course but  ",
      "post that uh a rough idea about how much is the \nmaintenance so typically the maintenance from  ",
      "sixth year onward would you you need to have \nthe replacement of inverter it&#39;s a one time  ",
      "replacement cost every 5 years you have to spell \naround 15 to 20,000 rupees depending on the type  ",
      "of system that you have taken and yeah for the \ncleaning typically 2 to 3,000 Rupees is the annual  ",
      "expenditure that you do that&#39;s nothing absolutely \nuh what I have heard is there is a minimum bill  ",
      "which every state government electricity MADCL \nfor example in Maharashtra minimum bill will be  ",
      "charged does that also get waved off if I have a \nsolar system unfortunately fixed bill will always  ",
      "stay okay right unless you install slightly more \nsolar okay and you get some offset but the offset  ",
      "amount is very small it&#39;s minus they call it \nAPPC rate which is a very minimal rate 2 and a  ",
      "half three rupees that&#39;s it so compensation that \nyou would get for any additional energy that you  ",
      "produce under net metering scheme if you export \nthat additional power to MADCL for every unit  ",
      "you&#39;ll get much much smaller amount so you pay at \n13 rupees but they will pay back at 2 and a half  ",
      "3 rupees only okay got it but then again because \nyou mentioned one term net metering right now what  ",
      "I could visualize with that is uh assume that I \nconsumed only 4,000 units but I my my solar was  ",
      "able to generate 5,000 units what about those 1000 \nunits is that something is that got to do with net  ",
      "metering or correct so I I&#39;ll tell you uh on a \nsimple terms on a monthly bill basis right let&#39;s  ",
      "say your monthly consumption is 300 units. So the \nare three cases case-1 300 units consumption where  ",
      "your solar is producing 300 units correct. So \neverything is going to be offset your monthly  ",
      "bill at the end of the month is only going to be \nfixed bill. Exactly right only low cost bill which  ",
      "will come which anyways is always going to stay \nsecond case let&#39;s say your consumption is still  ",
      "300 units but you are only able to produce let&#39;s \nsay 250 units of power from solar got it right so  ",
      "50 units deficit will be there that is the deficit \nyou&#39;ll draw from the grid and you&#39;ll pay for those  ",
      "50 units to the grid so in rainy months when the \ngeneration is going to go down you&#39;ll still pay a  ",
      "slight bit of amount to the grid and let&#39;s say 300 \nunits you have consumed but solar has produced in  ",
      "a summer good month 350 units so you have excess \n50 units okay that will get to your credit so it  ",
      "is like a import export getting tracked you can \njust imagine it as if it&#39;s a bank account you have  ",
      "a credit and debit that is happening every month \nand at the end of the month you&#39;ll get the total  ",
      "bill offset of import export so for example in the \nmonth of in the summer months let us say let&#39;s say  ",
      "April May and a part of June also these days let&#39;s \nsay I&#39;m able to generate more than what I consumed  ",
      "so that will be like an excess that I have in let \nus say during the Rainy Seasons uh I was able to  ",
      "consume more but produce less than whatever excess \nI have they&#39;ll get set off but let&#39;s say at the  ",
      "end of March I still have some excess units left \nwhat happens with that as I told you that gets  ",
      "settled at a small rate in some states they do \nit on a monthly cycle basis in some states it&#39;s  ",
      "an annual cycle so it depends on the states again \ngot it got it okay I had heard also something like  ",
      "like you mentioned one technical term net metering \nI had something in my mind which is like off grid  ",
      "and on I read it somewhere what what is that so \nthere are three types of systems uh basically on  ",
      "grid system off grid system and hybrid systems \non grade systems they do not couple with battery  ",
      "you don&#39;t need battery you directly couple it \nwith the grid okay and you get power from Sol  ",
      "and grid together seamlessly you don&#39;t understand \nwhich power is coming from solar although you can  ",
      "measure both the power separately so that is \ncalled as on grid system doesn&#39;t need battery  ",
      "and typically urban areas where the power \ncuts are low those are area those are the  ",
      "areas where on grid systems are installed okay \noff grid system is the one where you do not have  ",
      "any grid supply so you need to have battery \nand solar they work together in tandem and  ",
      "then you can utilize solar energy to drive your \nequipment up especially you can imagine remote are  ",
      "discom supplies are not there correct so that \nis where the off grid systems are installed  ",
      "and there is third type which is called as hybrid \ncorrect it is between on and off grid where there  ",
      "are major power cuts for example let&#39;s say your \nfarmhouse you have a grid supply but there are  ",
      "major power cuts so you can have a both grid as \nwell as battery and you can drive your off grid  ",
      "system with solar so to be really honest whatever \nyou have been telling me for the past whatever  ",
      "15-20 minutes I&#39;m totally convinced on you know \ninstalling a solar system or solar rooftop system  ",
      "at my place but I still have a question that \nwhatever calculations you told me that for 3  ",

      "it if this much units are not produced we will \nbear the risk who Bears the risk basically of  ",

      "gave the maximum retail this is the way",
      "I do okay I don&#39;t just simply put the",
      "shares I&#39;m very unemotional share",
      "highest return before the fall share I",
      "will start putting money Suppose there",
      "are three shares which is giving the",
      "highest return 1 two 3 yes I will put",

      "because I&#39;ve so I&#39;ve seen him do this",
      "where which I don&#39;t do even today but he",
      "does this where if he if he&#39;s bought a",
      "stock and it&#39;s gone up by 30 40 50%",
      "he&#39;ll buy it again and that average",
      "comes down to 25 then it again goes back",
      "to 50% he will buy again again it comes",
      "down to 30 but then he&#39;s pyramiding it",
      "on top so when it starts going up again",
      "and if the story is intact in that",
      "entire Journey the the returns become",
      "insane because he&#39;s buying again and",

      "reasonable to you it&#39;s your taking but",
      "right now everything is overvalued even",
      "defense is at 90 HL and mzar sitting at",
      "70 and 90 70 it&#39;s okay I&#39;m saying that",
      "is the risk that you can take but how do",
      "you find good stocks now which is at 50p",
      "because most of them are already or you",
      "wait for a correction and just wait I",
      "have it with me I have it with me but",
      "they are not good stocks you know they",
      "uh they&#39;re not uh like for example uh",
      "what was the Tata motor speed uh that&#39;s",
      "Lev okay fine it&#39;s okay to buy",
      "traditional companies when HDFC is",
      "trading lower TCS is trading lower",
      "correct correct but again when you say",
      "defense because it is not like 2 300",
      "times P right yeah and it is not like an",
      "kind of a story correct",
      "30",
      "Max",
      "25 keep going up and down doesn&#39;t matter",
      "and don&#39;t forget you&#39;re averaging right",
      "so how does it affect you okay if you",
      "just sit on",
      "one and you&#39;re crying no that&#39;s a",
      "problem you bought more shares how does",
      "it matter corre but as long as the p is",
      "not so high that it crashes to",
      "fundamentals are good yeah and it",
      "crashes to a level that you can never",
      "bounce back so that that is where the P",
      "becomes important crazy P don&#39;t touch",
      "okay somebody&#39;s asking a very nice",
      "question Ashish sha he&#39;s saying after 15",
      "years can Nifty reach one lakh today it",
      "is at 23,000 very easily of course three",
      "15 years though I think you said very",
      "long time I don&#39;t know how what is your",
      "average age okay uh you know how to do",
      "have you have you ever told them the",
      "power of compounding yeah they all know",
      "power of compound every four years Baba",
      "just think now just take your Excel and",
      "start doing it go crazy so what happens",
      "is I&#39;ll just explain it so you put one",
      "lakh today it becomes 2 lak in let&#39;s say",
      "four years yeah so two lakhs become four",
      "lakhs in 8 years yeah okay look at the",
      "last two years last two four years yeah",
      "it goes crazy the amount of money makes",
      "the last last two yeah is crazy yeah so",
      "that is basically the compounding only",
      "works for 20 to 25 years so technically",
      "in that front if Nifty doubles every",
      "four years or let&#39;s say five years worst",
      "case 5 years to double you go crazy with",
      "the money no so that means if we are at",
      "23,000 today we will be at 46,000 in 10",
      "5 years and in 10 years we should hit",
      "around 75 to one lakh is so in next 10",
      "years you should hit that amount I&#39;m",
      "talking about again guys power of",
      "compounding how much ever said is less",
      "yeah open your Excel sheet",
      "yeah I&#39;m assuming fundamentally good",
      "stocks right",
      "okay one lakh becomes two lakhs two lakh",
      "becomes four lakhs four lakhs become 8",
      "lakhs now look at this now 8 lakh is",
      "becoming 16 and 16 is becoming 32 yeah",
      "so for that you have to be in that 20",
      "year for compounding right one lakh has",
      "become 32 come on yeah but but in the 10",
      "years one lak has become two two lak has",
      "become four yeah so very interesting so",
      "Ashish is saying I&#39;m 35 and I&#39;m working",
      "at securance so I think he&#39;s Ashish sh",
      "Hi asish how are",
      "you okay so I&#39;ll take one more question",
      "somebody&#39;s saying uh what if any War",
      "happens tomorrow how much will it affect",
      "compounding Cloud chiral is asking oh it",
      "cannot it it will not touch compounding",
      "that&#39;s that it&#39;ll touch it&#39;ll affect it",
      "if you get scared in fact you should buy",
      "more at that time your compounding will",
      "go at a much faster Pace absolutely",
      "don&#39;t get scared during war no no when",
      "there is war or when there&#39;s a crash I",
      "keep telling him you know when he was he",
      "was not even in this field you know he",
      "remembers uh you know I&#39;m waiting for a",
      "crash so you know and I used to say",
      "Shanks crash you know I used to do this",
      "even now you&#39;re waiting for even even",
      "now he&#39;s in full cash waiting for crash",
      "even now he&#39;s not invested in the market",
      "yeah yeah okay we&#39;ll take one last",
      "question guys we take one last question",
      "um okay which time in your younger days",
      "does the market remind you of the",
      "present moment in the market this this",
      "kind of euphoria somewhere in the past",
      "where you saw but that was very",
      "unfortunate time that was that time okay",
      "so I should not give this example but",
      "Isa fundamentally",
      "ma but what was the vi around you during",
      "because I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t you didn&#39;t",
      "invest in because it was physical shares",
